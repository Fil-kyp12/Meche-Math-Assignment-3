%Implementation of finite difference approximation
%for Jacobian of multidimensional function
%INPUTS:
%fun: the mathetmatical function we want to differentiate
%X: the input value of fun that we want to compute the derivative at
%OUTPUTS:
%J: approximation of Jacobian of fun at x
function [J, num_evals] = approximate_jacobian(fun,X)
%set the step size to be tiny
dx_scalar = 1e-6;

f0 = fun(X); %evaluate function to determine number of outputs
num_evals = 1; %count calls
num_in = length(X);     %determine dimension of the input vector
num_out = length(f0);   %determine dimension of the output vector

%initialize the dx vector
dX = zeros(size(X));

%initialize the Jacobian to be a matrix
%with height num_out and width num_in
J = zeros([num_out,num_in]);

%iterate through each scalar input of fun
for n = 1:num_in
    %set dx vector so it has the form:
    %[0,...,0,dx_scalar,0,...,0]^T
    %where the nonzero element is at dx
    dX(n) = dx_scalar;

    %Use finite differences to compute the vector dfun/dx_n
    %partial derivative of the function 
    %w/respect to the nth element of X
    %the result should be a vector quantity
    dfun_dx_n = (fun(X + dX) - fun(X - dX))/(2*dx_scalar);
    num_evals = num_evals + 2; % account for the two above calls

    %Set the nth column of J to dfun/dx_n
    J(:,n) = dfun_dx_n;

    dX(n) = 0; %reset the dx vector to [0,...,0]^T
